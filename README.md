The Prashar Lake is a freshwater lake, situated at a height of 2,730 metres (8,960 ft) in the Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh. It is believed that the lake was built by Bhim, one of the Pandavas brothers, that named after a sage named Prashar who meditated on the bank of this lake. Distance of this lake from Mandi is about 42km.
It can be reached in two ways. Either by Mandi or from Bajaura in Kullu Valley. Both routes are 49 km (30 mi). Thereâ€™s a floating island in the lake which covers 7% of the area of the lake and moves in all directions. This floating island makes it quite sacred for people, although such a phenomenon is naturally found all over the world.
